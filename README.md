## Branching Strategy

This section describes how to create a proper naming for a new branch.
  
**Structure of the naming.**

Name the branch in the following way: 
```bash
<prefix>/<issue-id>-<short-description>
```
Where:
- `<prefix>` is one of:
  - `feature` for new features;
  - `bugfix` for bug fixes;
  - `refactor` for code refactoring/customization.
- `<issue-id>` is the ID of the related issue in your issue tracking system.
- `<short-description>` is a brief and hyphenated description of the change.

Examples:
- `feature/123-add-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/456-fix-login-error`
- `refactor/789-optimize-main-menu-code`
