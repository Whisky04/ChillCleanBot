🧹 Cleaning duties include: 
✅ 1) Cleaning the stove (with Ajax or regular dish detergent) and tabletop in the kitchen. 
✅ 2) Wiping down the dining table in the kitchen.
✅ 3) Vacuum the floor in the kitchen, bathroom, toilet, and the entire hallway.
✅ 4) Clean the sink and the bathtub in the bathroom from yellow plaque with a sponge and Ajax cleaner (it's in the kitchen).
✅ 5) Do the same with the sink in the toilet.
✅ 6) Pour the special cleaner that is in the toilet into the toilet.
✅ 7) Wash the floor in the kitchen, bathroom, toilet and hallway.
✅ 8) Taking the garbage out of the kitchen and changing bags. The bags are under a kitchen sink.

‼️ And of course, if someone has made a mess: left any surface in the block dirty, he has to clean up after himself, no matter whose cleaning week it is.

🙌 If you have changes in your schedule and won't be able to clean on your assigned week - don't hesitate to inform others or just propose an exchange of weeks with any other neighbor using "Change weeks with another user" functionality!
