⚠️ Close the entrance door with a key everytime you leave or enter the block. In addition, close the second door to hallway.
⚠️ Keep quite after 11PM.

✅ Wiping down the dining table in the kitchen.
✅ Vacuum the floor in the kitchen, bathroom, toilet, and the entire hallway.
✅ Clean the sink and the bathtub in the bathroom from yellow plaque with a sponge and Ajax cleaner (it's in the bathroom on shelves).
